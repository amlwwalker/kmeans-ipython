# Simple KMeans implemented from scratch

Ipython notebook outlining how kmeans works, and with a second ipython notebook that requires the user to fill in the algorithm to calculate the distance between each point and each cluster center, using pythagoras' theorem.

## Instructions:
When prompted for password (twice), give the password of the `decodedadmin` account

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amlwwalker/kmeans-ipython.git
cd kmeans-ipython
./setup
```

The `setup` script will also start the notebook, however if the terminal is closed, you can start the notebook without reinstalling dependencies by running `./start` within the repo root directory.

(open `model.ipynb` for teacher, and `exercise.ipynb` for students)
